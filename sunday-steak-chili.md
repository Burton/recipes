# Sunday Steak Chili

## Notes

This is the chili you want a big bowl of when you settle in to watch the kickoff on a cool September afternoon. It has a lot of ingredients and layers and steps and _stuff_, which makes it both delicious and perfect for a football morning; it gives you something to actively _do_ other than pace around wondering when your team's playmaking wide receiver will get over that nasty ACL tear.

Despite the ingredients, it's not fussy, and should be pretty adaptable. I can easily imagine switching out the steak for pork, or sausage, or lamb, or whatever. The best thing about this chili is actually the chili itself. Some chili recipes are actually soup recipes in disguise, where you do all this painstaking sauteeing and slow-cookery only to wind up with meat and vegetables in a puddle of, basically, broth. This is not one of those. The sauce comes together, thanks to ingredients like cornmeal, pinto beans, and - let's face it - beef fat into a rich _gravy_, the kind that sticks to a good slice of cornbread without soaking it.

## Ingredients

For ease of mind and sanity, I've divided the ingredients roughly into the steps in which you'll use them. Cooking this chili isn't an activity; it's a story.

### The Meat

* 3 lbs beef shoulder, cubed into 1" cubes

### The Sauce Base

* 3 large dried ancho chiles, pan-toasted and soaked
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes, ideally fire-roasted
* 1 tbsp cumin

### The Spice Mix

* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 tbsp coriander
* 1 tbsp sweet paprika
* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp espresso powder

### The Liquids

* 2 28oz cans crushed tomatoes (minus the half-cup you use for the sauce base)
* 1 bottle Modelo Negro or similar dark beer

### The Veggies

* 2 large diced white onions
* 2 large jalape√±o, seeds removed, diced
* 2 cans pinto beans, drained

_I'm sympathetic to the idea that rehydrated dried beans would be better here, but that honestly seems like a lot of extra time and fuss and waiting for, really, no good reason. "But when I rehydrate beans myself," I hear you say, "I do so in a deeply flavorful broth that imparts flavor to the beans." To which I reply: "You're about to dump them into a pot of chili. Relax."_

### What Pulls It All Together

* 1/2 cup masa harina or cornmeal (or more as needed, depending on how thick you like your chili)

### Top It Off

* cheddar cheese
* sour cream
* lime slices
* cornbread
* not cilantro

_I'm serious about the last one. Cilantro is a leaf. While there are some dishes that are enhanced by the presence of leaves on top, this is not one of them. If you serve someone a bowl of chili that [looks like this](http://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/chili-22.jpg), just remove yourself from the situation._

## Instructions

Season the meat generously with salt and pepper. In a large heavy-bottomed pot (like a pasta pot), heat some neutral oil (like canola) on medium-high heat and brown them in batches, 1-2 minutes on a side. (The point is to get some [Maillard reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) going; actually cooking the meat through happens later.)

When all the meat is browned, turn the heat down to medium and add the meat back to the pot. Add the spice mix. (Notice there's no salt in the spice mix? You'll see why in a minute.) Cook to integrate and toast the spices, for about five minutes or until really fragrant. Stir frequently.  

Add the onions and jalapenos to brown them. Okay, _this_ is why there was no salt in the spice mix. Salt encourages veggies (and just about anything that's made of cells) to give off liquid, which is not what you want here. You want to more brown the veggies than braise them, and you want them to save their liquid for later. (Also, given the inherent salt content of some of the other ingredients, I find it smarter to wait until you're basically done, and then salt the whole thing to taste. No one likes salty chili.)

Now, if your veggies _do_ give off a lot of liquid, that's okay; just let it slowly simmer out. What you should _not_ do, under any circumstance, is get impatient and crank the heat up; this will turn your delicate steak cubes into nicely-browned shoeleather. This is not an irreversable mistake, but fixing it involves fishing all the steak out, putting it in a big bowl, and hand-shredding it with two forks, and is not at all fun.

Anyway. Once the results of your steak-and-veggie activity look really melded and delicious, add the sauce base to the pot. You should decide _how much_ of it to add based on taste (each batch is different in spice), but know that the flavor will mellow a lot while it cooks. So if your sauce starts out at, say, a seven on the spice-ometer (you _did_ taste it, right?), it will probably wind up at a four-to-five. Also, you can always add more.

Next, add the bottle of beer and one whole can of crushed tomatoes. Turn the heat down to medium-low so the mixture just simmers. (As with before, violent boiling = meat toughening = guests leaving = you gorging on chili = a potentially very unpleasant Monday. So keep the heat low.) Reserve the rest of the other can if you need more liquid later.

Cook this for an hour. On low.

Once the stew meat is soft, take a potato masher and lightly mash the whole pot so the meat breaks into chunks. If you have to (or just want to!), you can take the meat out and chop it up; this isn't the place to be fussy about technique. What you want to wind up with is pieces of meat that are (a) small enough to really integrate with the overall chili but (b) big enough that you actually have something to chew on admist the gravy-like background texture of chili.

Add the two cans of beans, and the masa or cornmeal. Stir vigorously to integrate.

Cook the whole thing for another hour, cover off, on low. You want the flavors to come together and the consistency to really thicken. Taste a few times during this step, and add more salt/pepper/chili powder as needed to help the flavors.

Garnish and eat.
