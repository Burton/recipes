Makes 12-16 fritters.

## Ingredients

### The Fritters

* 2 large leeks, halved and sliced 1/4" thick
* 3-4 ears of corn, kernels cut off
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1/2 cup white flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
* Canola or other vegetable oil, for frying

### The Sour Cream

* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* Pinch of salt & pepper, to taste

## Instructions

Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet until hot enough to fry in. Drop the batter in in 1/4-cup portions (about the size of an ice cream scoop), press down lightly to flatten, and fry about 2 minutes on a side. Place each batch on a paper towel and sprinkle lightly with sea salt as it comes out. Periodically refresh the pan with new oil as needed.

To make the lemon sour cream, just mix all that stuff together.
